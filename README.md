### **Updates**

#### Sep 23 2023
Updated Spring Boot to 2.7.16 and asm to 9.5, lombok to 1.18.30. now this project can build and run on Java 21

#### Feb 12 2022
Updated Spring Boot to 2.6.3 and Apache Struts 2.5.29 GA, asm to 9.2, now this project can build and run on Java 17

## Motivation
I am a big fan of Struts2 since 2007 but almost no one's using it really now nor wants to adapt to a new project. So I created this sample project to play with it.

* Spring Boot 2.2.6.RELEASE
* Apache Struts 2.5.22 GA
* Struts2 jQuery Plugin 4.0.3
* struts2-convention-plugin

## Prerequisites
