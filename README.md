Spring Boot2 with Struts 2.5
=========================
This is a sample Spring boot2 application integrated with Struts 2.5 and Struts2 jQuery Plugin

### **Updates**
#### Feb 12 2022
Updated Spring Boot to 2.6.3 and Apache Struts 2.5.29 GA, asm to 9.2, now this project can build and run on Java 17

## Motivation
I am a big fan of Struts2 since 2007 but almost no one's using it really now nor wants to adapt to a new project. So I created this sample project to play with it.  

## Technology Stack
* Spring Boot 2.2.6.RELEASE
* Apache Struts 2.5.22 GA
* Struts2 jQuery Plugin 4.0.3
* struts2-convention-plugin
* Junit 5

## Prerequisites

* Java 8 or greater
* Apache maven 3.2 or later
