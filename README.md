Spring Boot2 with Struts 2.5
=========================
This is a sample Spring boot2 application integrated with Struts 2.5 and Struts2 jQuery Plugin

## Motivation
I am a big fan of Struts2 since 2007 but almost no one's using it really now nor wants to adapt to a new project. So I created this sample project to play with it.  

## Technology Stack
* Spring Boot 2.2.6.RELEASE
* Apache Struts 2.5.22 GA
* Struts2 jQuery Plugin 4.0.3
* struts2-convention-plugin
* Junit 5

## Prerequisites

* Java 8 or greater
